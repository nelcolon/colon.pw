"Passion is the sentiment you take from your motivation and apply it constantly"

Or something around those lines.

I was reading a book recently which talked about this, how to stay motivated, what to do to motivate yourself, and things like that. The book just helped me to understand that I do not have any motivation to basically do anything, and that I also don't have passion for anything besides wasting my time. But seriously, I don't know if that's a generational thing or normal, since social media has warped the idea in such ways that is almost impossible to understand how everyone has a perfect life those days.

Struggling is not normal anymore, being mundane isn't normal anymore. Your life deserves to be exciting, and if it isn't, you don't belong. 

I hate that sentiment and the way social media has reshaped our minds to be addicted to the likes, the retweets, the views. But I also don't blame the people who fall on the trap of it either, at the end they are solving a real need, the need for humans to be social entities. We at nature are social creatures, we enjoy being around like minded people. It's something we can't deny. Not even the self diagnosed "asocials". 

Anyway, this just works as a first post that I was trying to prepare. 

Don't even remember what I was doing and for what reason before this...
