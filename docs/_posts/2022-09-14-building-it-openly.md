Recently I was looking into old dev posts and recommendations for becoming more productive and achieving goals that are seemingly impossible but it's truly just the fact that usually lacks dedication and consistency, one of it's suggestions for people building an application or just like , trying to accomplish it's goals is this one.

> "Openly create something"

As the phrase would imply, it's that you should have an open record of things you're doing, in this case, this blog is to share exactly that. What I'm doing, where am I going and what I truly want to accomplish?

Last 2 weeks I've been working on developing an idea, it started out of frustration that raised after trying to find my own home to live since me and girlfriend (soon to be wife) want to move out.

We came up with some sketches, and found that the best way to open this project, is by creating an app that improves on all the experience with awesome features that we are still working on so far.

So, what's next? 
- Learning to code is the first and most important thing right now.
- Prepare all the documentation for the app
- Start doing a market research to see if the solution is actually a solution that the market will use. Don't need nor want to spend time and resources on something people simply don't care.

That's all for now, I'll keep updating as long I can and as often as my other commitments allow me.
